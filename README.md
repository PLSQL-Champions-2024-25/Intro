## Problem Statement  
This assignment involves designing and implementing a database system to manage a [describe the system, e.g., library management system, employee records system, etc.]. The system will include multiple tables with relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many) to store and manage data efficiently. The goal is to execute SQL commands to create, manipulate, and retrieve data while demonstrating proficiency in DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL operations.

## Tasks  

### 1. Install Oracle Database Administration  
- Follow the installation guide to set up Oracle Database on your machine.  
- Ensure the database is configured correctly and accessible via Oracle SQL Developer.  
- Create a Pluggable Database (PDB) named `grp_studentID_pdb_assI` (e.g., `mon_12345_pdb_assI`, `tue_12345_pdb_assI`, etc.).  
- Keep all tables in this PDB.  

### 2. Execute SQL Commands in Oracle Database  
#### System Management System  
- Design a conceptual diagram illustrating the tables with relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many).  
- Create Tables: Implement the relationships defined in your diagram.  

#### SQL Commands  
- Create the tables from your diagram.  
- Insert, update, and delete data.  
- Perform joins to retrieve related data across tables.  
- Use DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL operations.  
- Execute basic SQL commands (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).  
- Perform joins and subqueries.  
- Identify records created in the past week.  
- Write a query to find records added in the past 7 days.  
- Retrieve the top 5 highest values in each category.  
- Retrieve records where an entity has more than 3 related transactions.  

### 3. Upload Your Script to GitHub  
#### GitHub Account  
- Join the GitHub Organization repository: [ClickMe](https://github.com/[OrganizationName]).  

#### Set Up a Repository  
- Create a new private repository (e.g., `grp_studentId_firstName_lastName_assI`).  
  Example: `mon_12125_eric_maniraguha_assI`, `tue_12125_eric_maniraguha_assI`.  

#### Upload Your Script  
- Save all SQL commands in a file (e.g., `sql_test_script.sql`).  
- Push the SQL file to GitHub.  

#### Create a README File  
- Include a problem statement describing the system being managed.  
- Provide a short description of the SQL commands executed.  
- Add screenshots of SQL queries, results, and the conceptual diagram.  
- Provide clear explanations of the results and transactions.

## Submission  
- Provide the link to your GitHub repository where the SQL script, README file, and conceptual diagram are uploaded.  

**Total Points:** /10 (including 1.5 additional marks for good documentation).  

---

## Additional Notes  
1. Include a short introduction in the README starting with your ID, Names, and Concentration.  
2. Provide a problem statement in the README describing the system being managed.  
3. Include a conceptual diagram showing at least four related tables with relationships.  
4. Show the output of SQL queries and transactions.  
5. Include screenshots of SQL queries, results, and the conceptual diagram.  

**Deadline:** February 27, 2025, at 11:59 PM. Late submissions will not be accepted.
