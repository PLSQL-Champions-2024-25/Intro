Assignment II Task:
1.	Install Oracle Database Administration:
	Follow the installation guide to set up Oracle Database on your machine.
	Ensure the database is configured correctly and can be accessed via Oracle SQL Developer.
	Create a Pluggable Database (PDB) named grp_studentID_pdb_assI (e.g., mon_12345_pdb_assI, tue_12345_pdb_assI, wed_12345_pdb_assI, thu_12345_pdb_assI).
	Keep all the tables in this PDB.
2.	Execute SQL Commands in Oracle Database:
	System Management System: 
o	Design a conceptual diagram illustrating the tables with relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many).
o	Create Tables: Implement the relationships defined in your diagram.
	SQL Commands: Write and execute SQL commands to: 
o	Create the tables from your diagram.
o	Insert, update, and delete data.
o	Perform joins to retrieve related data across tables.
o	Use DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL operations.
o	Execute basic SQL commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
o	Perform joins and subqueries.
o	Identify records created in the past week
o	Write a query to find records added in the past 7 days
o	Retrieve the top 5 highest values in each category
o	Retrieve records where an entity has more than 3 related transactions
3.	Upload Your Script to GitHub:
	GitHub Account: To this GitHub Organization repository ClickMe
	Set Up a Repository: 
o	Create a new repository (e.g., grp_studentId_firstName_lastName_assI example: mon_12125_eric_maniraguha_assI, Tue_12125_eric_maniraguha_assI mon_12125_eric_maniraguha_assI); which should be private.
	Upload Your Script: 
o	Save all SQL commands in a file (e.g., sql_test_script.sql).
o	Push the sql file on GitHub
	Create a README File: 
o	Include a problem statement that describes the system you are managing with your database (e.g., a system for managing a library, employee records, etc.).
o	Provide a short description of the SQL commands executed.
o	Add screenshots of your SQL queries, results, and your conceptual diagram.
o	Provide clear explanations of the results and transactions.
4.	Submission:
	Provide the link to your GitHub repository where the SQL script, README file, and the conceptual diagram are uploaded. Total Points: /10 (including 1.5 additional marks for good documentation) Additional Notes:
1.	Short Introduction in the Readme which starts with your ID, Names, and Concentration.
2.	Problem Statement: Provide a problem statement in the README that describes the system being managed by the database.
3.	Conceptual Diagram: Include a diagram that shows at least four related tables with relationships.
4.	Results: Show the output of SQL queries and transactions.
5.	Screenshots: Include screenshots of SQL queries, results, and your conceptual diagram.
